# Structural variant analysis of _Halobacterium salinarum_ NRC-1

This collection of scripts intends to process DNA-Seq (ONT) data in order to find insertions and excisions in the _Halobacterium salinarum_ genome. This is not a pipeline, the scripts have to be executed in order, and adjusts (such as file paths) probably would be necessary for it to function properly.
